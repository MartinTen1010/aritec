                </h5>
              <p>
            A flange is a plate or ring that attaches to a pipe or valve with the purpose of providing extra support for strength, blocking off a pipeline, implementing a secure attachment of other items, and more. They are usually welded to or secured with studs and nuts and can be found at the end of various pipeline connections.

Our flanges can be customized to meet any specifications and are always manufactured according to international standards such as ANSI or ASME and many more. The most common ANSI/ASME pressure classes are 150#, 300#, 400#, 600#, 900#, 1500#, and 2500#.

Flanges are manufactured in a variety of materials including stainless steel, cast iron, aluminum, brass, bronze, plastic, and other specialized metals. The most commonly used material is forged carbon steel which we can provide with a machined surface.           </p>

              <p>
             The Dismantling Joint is a fitting made out of two flanges and attached to a pipe which accommodates up to 50mm longitudinal adjustment and that it can be attached to the required end with supplied tie bars.

Dismantling Joints give the benefit of being able to disassemble easily other elements on the pipeline as well as for maintenance purposes. It gives versatility to the designer during its planning stage and to the engineer during the installation.

              LOADING ARM 
                </h5>
              <p>
          The Riser is fixed to the jetty and is connected to the terminal piping system.
At the upper of the riser is secured a cubic structure supporting the inboard arm. Two bearings, two swivel joints concentric to the bearings and a 90° elbow flanged to the joints are installed inside of this cubic structure. Disassembling of just only the 90° elbow gives you a possibility to substitute joints and gaskets immediately.
Even without the 90° elbow and joints during the maintenance operation, the marine loading arm can work in each position without any limitations and dangers. <br>
                
                  The Outboard Arm has a tubular section which is equal to the nominal diameter of the Marine Loading Arm.
An auto-levelling system composed by triple swivel and flanged elbow is connected at the end section of the outboard arm, this system allows the best coupling of the manifold to the vessel.   <br>
                  
                  It is built by a self-supported structure anchored to the cubic structure by a thrust bearing.
A connection bearing for the main part of outboard arm and its joint, complete with a 90° flanged elbow is placed at the front end of the inboard loading arm.
Excluding the 90° elbow there is the possibility to replace rapidly the joint and gaskets of the outboard arm.
During the maintenance operation even without the 90° elbow and joints, the marine loading arm can operate in every position without limits.
The thrust bearing and the joint allow to the outboard loading arm a vertical rotation to be controlled and counterbalanced by a pantograph system with double counterweights.
The back end of inboard loading arm is composed by a fixed counter weight support system.
If needed, the loading arm can be equipped with a hydraulic motor and by means of an endless screws the hydraulic motor can be regulated to assure balancing of the loading arm in full and empty conditions.
